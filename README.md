## 🚀 my-kaggle-journey
I started my journey of learning data science through various platforms, including **Kaggle**. Here are some of the projects and notebooks I have worked on:

### 🔥 Skills & Tools Learned  
✅ **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)**  
✅ **Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  
✅ **Machine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised Learning)**  
✅ **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
✅ **Feature Engineering & Model Optimization**  
✅ **Geospatial Analysis**  

### 🧷 Datasets

### 💡 About This Repository
- I created this repo to document my journey in learning data science on Kaggle.
- I believe that learning from hands-on practice and real projects is the best way to understand concepts
- This repo will be updated as I progress.
